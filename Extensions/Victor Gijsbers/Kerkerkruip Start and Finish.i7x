Kerkerkruip Start and Finish by Victor Gijsbers begins here.

Use authorial modesty.

[ Start and finish takes care of:
	showing the title screen and help menu
	handling difficultly levels
	winning and losing
]


To say Kerkerkruip:
	say "[italic type]Kerkerkruip[roman type]".


Chapter - The title screen activity

Showing the title screen is an activity.

[ Show the title screen in the place of the when play begins rules ]

The show the title screen rule is listed instead of the when play begins stage rule in the startup rules.
This is the show the title screen rule:
	carry out the showing the title screen activity;

Last after showing the title screen:
	consider the when play begins rules;



Section - Detecting whether or not the Gargoyle config file has been applied

[ We can detect whether or not the Gargoyle config file has been applied by checking whether one of the text colours has been changed. Warning, user style 2 will be pretty ugly if it has! ]

The Gargoyle config file was used is a truth state variable.

First before showing the title screen (this is the detect whether the config file has been applied rule):
	detect the gargoyle config file;

To detect the gargoyle config file:
	(- DetectGargoyleConfigFile(); -).

Include (-
[ DetectGargoyleConfigFile	res;
	res = glk_style_measure( gg_mainwin, style_User2, stylehint_TextColor, gg_arguments );
	if ( res && gg_arguments-->0 == $F400A1 )
	{
		(+ the Gargoyle config file was used +) = 1;
	}
];
-).



Section - The difficulty level

The difficulty is a number that varies.

Before showing the title screen:
	now difficulty is data value 2;

To set difficulty to (x - number):
	now difficulty is x;
	set data value 2 to difficulty;


Section - Player stats

[ Must be done before showing the title screen as some difficulty labels are gendered! ]
Before showing the title screen (this is the set gender rule):
	if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
		now the player is male;
	otherwise:
		now the player is female;

First after showing the title screen (this is the set up initial scores for the player rule):
	now permanent health of the player is 13;
	now melee of the player is 1;
	now defence of the player is 7;
	now body score of the player is 5;
	now mind score of the player is 5;
	now spirit score of the player is 5;
	give the player a stat bonus;
	give the player a stat bonus;
	give the player a stat penalty;
	restore the health of the player;

To give the player a stat bonus:
	let i be a random number between 1 and 4;
	if i is 1:
		increase permanent health of the player by 1;
	if i is 2:
		increase body score of the player by 1;
	if i is 3:
		increase mind score of the player by 1;
	if i is 4:
		increase spirit score of the player by 1.

To give the player a stat penalty:
	let i be a random number between 1 and 4;
	if i is 1:
		decrease permanent health of the player by 1;
	if i is 2:
		decrease body score of the player by 1;
	if i is 3:
		decrease mind score of the player by 1;
	if i is 4:
		decrease spirit score of the player by 1.



Section - Applying the difficulty

After showing the title screen (this is the apply the difficulty rule):
	if difficulty is 0:
		increase health of the player by 5;
		increase permanent health of the player by 5;
		increase melee of the player by 1;
		increase defence of the player by 2;
	if difficulty is 1:
		increase health of the player by 3;
		increase permanent health of the player by 3;
		increase melee of the player by 1;		
		increase defence of the player by 1;
	if difficulty is 2:
		increase health of the player by 1;
		increase permanent health of the player by 1;
		increase defence of the player by 1;
	let k be 6 + difficulty;
	repeat with guy running through monsters:
		now health of guy is (k times health of guy) / 10;
	if difficulty is greater than 2:
		let n be difficulty - 2;
		repeat with guy running through monsters:
			repeat with i running from 1 to n:
				buff guy.
			
To buff (guy - a person):
	let m be a random number between 1 and 5;
	if m is 1:
		increase melee of guy by 1;
	if m is 2:
		increase defence of guy by 1;
	if m is 3:
		increase body score of guy by 1;
	if m is 4:	
		increase mind score of guy by 1;
	if m is 5:	
		increase spirit score of guy by 1.

Showing the text title screen is a truth state variable.

Rule for showing the title screen (this is the text title screen rule):
	shut down the status-window;[in case we've come to the menu with it open]
