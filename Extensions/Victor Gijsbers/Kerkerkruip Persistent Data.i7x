Kerkerkruip Persistent Data by Victor Gijsbers begins here.

Use authorial modesty.

[ Kerkerkruip doesn't preserve much data between play throughs, but it's important that the data it does preserve be reliably stored for future play throughs, including for new versions of Kerkerkruip. This file contains the code to manage the persistent data.

Monster statistics are however mangaged in the Monsters extension. ]

Chapter - General data storage

[ We store data in a table (and file). Both keys and values are integers. Keys can be skipped freely.

The table length should be longer than we need in order to have a buffer in case the player decides to go back to an older version.

Data entries (careful, may not be up to date!):
	1: total victories count
	2: current difficulty level
	3: highest level achieved
	4: victories count for the purpose of unlocking content
	5: main menu graphics desired (1 = yes, -1 = no) [code in Kerkerkruip Glimmr Additions.i7x]
	6: session flag [code in Kerkerkruip Glimmr Additions.i7x]
	7: window panels disabled (0 = enabled, 1 = disabled)
	8: menu hyperlinks (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled)
]

The File of Data Storage is called "KerkerkruipStorage".
The File of Legacy Storage is called "KerkerkruipData".

Table of Data Storage
key (number)	value (number)
--	--
with 14 blank rows

Table of Victories
Victories	Level	Best-Level
0	0	0

First before showing the title screen (this is the load the file of data storage rule):
	if File of Data Storage exists:
		read File Of Data Storage into the Table of Data Storage;
	otherwise if File of Legacy Storage exists:
		read File Of Legacy Storage into the Table of Victories;
		choose row 1 in Table of Victories;
		set data value 1 to the Victories entry, table only;
		set data value 2 to the Level entry, table only;
		set data value 3 to the Best-Level entry, table only;
		set data value 4 to the Victories entry;

To decide which number is data value (X - a number):
	if there is a key of X in the Table of Data Storage:
		choose row with a key of X in the Table of Data Storage;
		decide on the value entry;
	otherwise:
		decide on 0;

To set data value (X - a number) to (Y - a number), table only (this is data-value setting):
	if there is a key of X in the Table of Data Storage:
		choose row with a key of X in the Table of Data Storage;
	otherwise:
		choose a blank row in the Table of Data Storage;
		now the key entry is X;
	now the value entry is Y;
	if not table only:
		write File of Data Storage from Table of Data Storage;

To decide which number is the number of victories: decide on data value 1.

To decide which number is the best level: decide on data value 3.

To decide which number is the number of victories for the purpose of unlocking: decide on data value 4;
