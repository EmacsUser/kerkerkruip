Chapter - Parser error fix

[This error is redirected to another error type, meaning that the activity is run twice. For this reason we only print a line break for other errors.]
After printing a parser error when the latest parser error is not the noun did not make sense in that context error:
	say line break.

Section - Setting standard text colors

[ Note we don't set user style 2 so that it can be used to detect whether or not the Gargoyle config file has been applied - see Start and Finish ]

To set basic text color to (col - a glulx color value):
	(- SetBasicTextColor({col}); -)

Include (-

	[ SetBasicTextColor col i;

		col = ColVal(col);
		for (i = 0: i < (style_NUMSTYLES - 1) : i++)
 	 		glk_stylehint_set(wintype_Textbuffer, i, stylehint_TextColor, 0);
	];

-)

Before starting the virtual machine:
	set basic text color to g-black.


Chapter - Window-drawing rules
[There are two primary places where we need to redraw the windows. First, before reading a command should handle all in-game situations. But we also need the stats to reflect the last turn of the game when we've won, since this will most often be a combat turn that we have lost. For that, we hook into the activity for printing the player's "obituary".]

To redraw subsidiary content windows:
	if data value 7 is 0:
		follow the window-drawing rules for the stats-window;
		follow the window-drawing rules for the powers-window;
		follow the window-drawing rules for the inventory-window.

Before reading a command (this is the refresh side windows rule):
	redraw subsidiary content windows.
	
Before printing the player's obituary (this is the final refresh side windows rule):
	redraw subsidiary content windows.


Section - Statistics window	

Window-drawing rule for the stats-window when the stats-window is g-present (this is the construct stats window rule):
	move focus to stats-window, clearing the window;
	now long status is false;
	now attribute printed is false;
	consider the status combat stats rules;
	consider the short player form status rule;[the player's form]
	consider the status attribute rules;
	say "[if attribute printed is true]. [end if][bracket][link 1]detailed status report[end link][close bracket][line break][run paragraph on]";
	consider the unallocated faculty short status rule;[shortened message for any unassigned faculty points]
	say "[line break][run paragraph on]";
	consider the show basic stats rule;[show statistics]
	say run paragraph on;
	now long status is true;
	return to main screen.


Attribute printed is a truth state variable. Attribute printed is false.

To check initial position of attribute:
	if attribute printed is false:
		say "You are [run paragraph on]";
		now attribute printed is true;
	otherwise:
		say ", [run paragraph on]".

This is the unallocated faculty short status rule:
	if long status is false:
		if unallocated faculty is greater than 0:
			say "[italic type]Increase one of your faculties by typing 'body', 'mind', or 'spirit' ([unallocated faculty] point[if unallocated faculty is greater than 1]s[end if]).[roman type][line break][run paragraph on]".
	
Window-drawing rule for the stat-header-window when the stat-header-window is g-present (this is the construct stat header window rule):
	move focus to stat-header-window, clearing the window;
	say "[first custom style]Statistics[roman type]";

Window-drawing rule for the powers-window when the powers-window is g-present (this is the construct power window rule):
	move focus to powers-window, clearing the window;
	let pow be the number of granted powers;
	if pow is 0:
		say "[bold type]You have not yet acquired any special powers[roman type].";
	otherwise:
		[consider the status skill rules;]
		repeat with ability running through granted powers:
			if ability is the power of the ape:
				say "[if maximum ape power is not tiny and maximum ape power is not small and maximum ape power is not medium][link (the ability typecast to a number)][command text of the ability in sentence case][end link]: level [power level of the ability] (max [maximum ape power])[otherwise][link (the ability typecast to a number)]ape power[end link]: level [power level of the ability] (no special ability)[end if][run paragraph on]";
			otherwise:
				say "[link (the ability typecast to a number)][command text of the ability in sentence case][end link]: level [power level of the ability][run paragraph on]";
			if there is a power of ability in the Table of Enemy Powers:
				choose row with power of ability from the Table of Enemy Powers;
				say " ([faculty1 entry][if there is a faculty2 entry] & [faculty2 entry][end if])[run paragraph on]";
			say "[line break]";
	if pow < 3 and (turn count is 1 or the remainder after dividing turn count by 30 is 0):
		now power-tip-text is the next tip text;
	say "[line break][italic type]Tip:[roman type] [power-tip-text]";
	say "[line break][run paragraph on]";
	return to main screen.

Window-drawing rule for the powers-header-window when the powers-header-window is g-present (this is the construct powers header window rule):
	move focus to powers-header-window, clearing the window;
	say "[first custom style]Powers[roman type]";
	say run paragraph on;
	return to main screen.

	(- {O} -).

To decide what object is (N - a number) typecast to an object:
	(- {N} -).


Section - Powers window hyperlinks

		say "[bold type][T].[roman type][line break][description of the ability] [link 2]< back[end link][run paragraph on]";
		return to main screen;
		rule succeeds.

Hyperlink processing rule when the current hyperlink window is the powers-window and the current hyperlink ID is 2[i.e., we've hit the back button while reading the description of some power.]:

	say "[first custom style]Inventory[roman type]";
	say run paragraph on;
	return to main screen.


Chapter - Opening and closing windows

Toggling window panels is an action out of world. Understand "toggle info panels" or "info panels" or "toggle information panels" or "information panels" or "panels" as toggling window panels.

Understand "disable panels" or "disable info panels" or "disable information panels" as toggling window panels when data value 7 is 0.

Understand "enable panels" or "enable info panels" or "enable information panels" as toggling window panels when data value 7 is 1.

Understand "disable panels" or "disable info panels" or "disable information panels" as a mistake ("The information panels are already disabled.") when data value 7 is 1.

Understand "enable panels" or "enable info panels" or "enable information panels" as a mistake ("The information panels are already enabled.") when data value 7 is 0.

Carry out toggling window panels:
	shut down the status-window;
	if data value 7 is 1:
		set data value 7 to 0;
		open side windows;
		open up the status-window;
		say "The information panels have been enabled. Type PANELS to disable them again.";
	otherwise:
		set data value 7 to 1;
		close side windows;
		open up the status-window;
		say "The information panels have been disabled. Type PANELS to re-enable them."

	
To open side windows:
	if data value 7 is 1:
		rule fails;
	set the Gargoyle background color to the color g-white;
	[set up styles for side windows;]
	open up the stats-window;
	open up the powers-window;
	open up the inventory-window;
	
To close side windows:
	shut down the stats-window;
	shut down the inventory-window;
	

Section - Events

Last when play begins (this is the check info panel capacity rule):
	if data value 7 is 1:
		say "[bracket]Information panels are disabled. Type PANELS to enable them.[close bracket][line break][run paragraph on]";
	if data value 7 is 0:
		if width of the main-window is less than 102 or height of the main-window is less than 30:
			say "[bracket]Your game window is too small for you to use the information panels comfortably. Maximize your window, then type PANELS to enable them.[close bracket][line break][run paragraph on]";
			set data value 7 to 1;
	follow the open up game windows rule.

This is the open up game windows rule:
	open side windows;
	open up the status-window.



Section - Menus & windows

[We need to close and open the side windows when we visit the in-game help menus. "In-game menu checking" is a kind of action that identifies the way we get to the menus while playing the game.]

First before displaying (this is the fix our windows rule before displaying rule):
	close side windows;
	open up the status-window;

Last after displaying:
	shut down the status-window;
	if in-game menu-checking:
		open side windows;
		open up the status-window;



[We also need to reset the windows when a game is restored.]
After restoring from a saved game:
	shut down the status-window;
	close side windows;
	consider the check info panel capacity rule.
